TechSolutions is a national electronics retailer. They experienced rapid growth in the last year and have opened 50 new outlets. Each outlet sells electronic devices and related accessories, as well as store-specific gadgets. Outlets often have individual offers, but national marketing campaigns are often run, which influence the price of an item too. TechSolutions recently launched a loyalty program called GadgetPoints, which allows customers to get 1 free accessory for every 10 they purchase. It doesn’t matter which outlet they purchase an item at or which they redeem it at. TechSolutions has been thinking of launching an online store. They are also considering a monthly subscription that allows purchasers to get unlimited gadget servicing every month, as well as a discount on other devices. Now that we understand the business domain, we can start to explore how we can build systems to help TechSolutions achieve its goals!
